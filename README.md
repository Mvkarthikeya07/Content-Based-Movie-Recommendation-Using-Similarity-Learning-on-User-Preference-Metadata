# 🎬 Advanced Movie Recommendation System

This project is a movie recommendation web application developed using machine learning techniques. It suggests movies to users based on historical ratings and similarity between movies.

---

## 📌 About the Project

With a huge number of movies available online, users often find it difficult to choose what to watch. This project aims to reduce that effort by recommending movies that match a user’s interests using past rating data.

The system analyzes movie ratings and identifies similar movies to provide meaningful recommendations.

---

## 💡 Project Overview

The application uses movie and user rating datasets to build a recommendation model. Based on similarity calculations, it suggests movies that are closely related to the user’s choice. A Flask-based web interface allows users to interact easily with the system.
