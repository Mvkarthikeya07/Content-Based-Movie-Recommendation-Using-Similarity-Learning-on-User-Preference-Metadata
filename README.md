🎬 Design and Implementation of a Content-Based Movie Recommendation System

A Machine Learning–Driven Content-Based Recommender Web Application

📌 Overview

The Advanced Movie Recommendation System is a machine learning–powered web application that provides intelligent movie recommendations based on content similarity. The system analyzes movie metadata and computes similarity scores to recommend relevant movies in real time.

This project demonstrates end-to-end machine learning system development, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, similarity modeling, and deployment using a clean and modular Flask architecture.

🎯 Goals

Design a robust content-based recommendation engine

Apply text vectorization and similarity metrics

Deploy the ML model as an interactive web application

Ensure modularity, clarity, and reproducibility

Showcase applied machine learning in a real-world use case

🚀 Key Features

✔ Content-based movie recommendations
✔ Real-time similarity matching
✔ Clean and intuitive user interface
✔ Lightweight and fast inference
✔ Modular and maintainable codebase
✔ Graceful error handling

🧠 Recommendation Approach

The system uses Content-Based Filtering, a widely adopted technique in modern recommendation engines.

Methodology

Data Preparation
Movie metadata is cleaned and structured for analysis.

Feature Engineering
Textual features are transformed using TF-IDF Vectorization.

Similarity Measurement
Cosine Similarity is used to quantify relationships between movies.

Recommendation Generation
The top-N most similar movies are returned for a given input title.

This approach ensures recommendations are interpretable, scalable, and efficient.
